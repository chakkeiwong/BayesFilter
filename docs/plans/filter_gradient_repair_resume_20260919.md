# Filter execution repair recovery, September 19

Worktree: `/tmp/bayesfilter-filter-gradient-xla-validation-20260918`.
Branch: `repair/filter-gradient-xla-validation-20260918`.
Master: [repair program](filter_gradient_repair_master_20260917.md).
Detailed evidence: [execution record](filter_gradient_repair_execution_20260917.md).
Artifacts remain under the primary checkout's
`docs/plans/artifacts/filter-gradient-repair-20260917/`.

The user authorized execution repairs, preserved numerical algorithms and
tolerances, before/after comparisons, and commit/push. Main must remain gated
until full testing. Canonical LEDH rebuilding is excluded; unsupported claims
remain blocked. Only the two geometry initializers have approval to migrate
their random stream. Other seeded draws remain unchanged.

The original cumulative caps are still 4 GPU / 8 CPU process-hours. The
proposed increase to 16 GPU / 12 CPU hours has not received an answer. Through
01030, GPU charge is 14,352.925 seconds, leaving 47.075 seconds, which cannot
cover the runner's minimum 60-second test reservation. Do not launch GPU work
or modify the caps without the pending approval. Use the driver for authoritative
CPU accounting, including interrupted runs and supplemental charge files.
Through 01035, CPU charge is 26,346.748 seconds, leaving 2,453.252 seconds.
No campaign worker remains running at this recovery checkpoint.

```

GPU3 is the same-class contention alternative under the existing plan. The
driver checks contention, sets and verifies memory growth, hides GPUs for CPU
diagnostics, enforces timeouts and shares accounting/locking across worktrees.
Do not bypass the driver or launch parallel numerical workers.

Checkpoint `c4351f8c` is committed and pushed. Its shared tensor-program helper
builds full pullback graphs only when requested, including coefficients used
only in custom derivatives. Preparation sampling/push/resampling, coordinate
clipping and target shifting now have stable XLA boundaries. Review restored
route/time/shape/nonfinite vetoes before qualification.

The helper passes 22 CPU and GPU checks; six public pullback checks and all 11
sequential consumer checks pass on GPU. Preparation passes 46 checks on CPU
and GPU. The policy/controller group passes 59 checks. These are focused
results, not all-repository coverage.

The two-/four-date public endpoint measurements 01019/01018 preserve prior
candidate outputs exactly and match the frozen baseline within 8.882e-16.
Compared with the prior candidate, single-process host maxima fall by
245.4/409.8 MiB; GPU allocator peaks are unchanged. The four-date candidate
still exceeds original baseline host memory by 362.6 MiB. Harness review
reconstructed the old hash by reversing only an equivalent dictionary syntax
change. The descriptive analysis is `lazy-pullback-diagnostic-01019.json`;
old artifacts remain stale for terminal comparisons. No three-process result
or isolated causal memory attribution is established.

Full preparation run 01020 was stopped at 854.417 seconds after the first 45
checks, with 27.67 GiB RSS observed at 12:01. The first 36-dimensional P59
assembly test had not finished. Run 01024's 45-second stack localizes fitting
update tracing; the run times out at 120.520 seconds.

The next fitter patch defers existing accepted-update derivative construction,
preserving the fixed-design packed-core/target derivative and rejection rule.
All six focused CPU cases, all 37 existing fitting checks (01031), and all 12
scalar adjacent-TT consumer checks (01032) pass. GPU run 01030 times out after
five progress markers without JUnit; it remains incomplete. Run 01028 also
preserves an external-tape TensorList boundary failure affecting the prior
source. Passing tests enclose value and gradient as the actual scalar consumer
does; they do not establish a new external-tape fitter API.

Run 01033 times out at 301.873 seconds. Its 45-second stack has passed the
initial fit and reached model simulation; RSS snapshots are 6.45 GiB at 01:27
and 10.53 GiB at 04:20. The large consumer still has no passing outcome or
final peak. Capture a later stage/stack before another broad retry.

Run 01034 passes all six final CPU fitter checks after the closure edit;
01035 passes all 59 policy/controller checks. The static guard passes for
171 sources with 1,097 exact schema/reference exceptions; coverage is partial.
Focused Ruff and whitespace checks pass.

After compute approval, finish GPU fitting
qualification and the full P59 group, then resolve the remaining reachable
source audit before freezing source/harness for terminal repeats. Avoid
repeating the broad 900-second preparation job without a discriminating repair.

All F01--F20 terminal decisions remain open. Other carried blockers include
the predator-prey residual about 1.578e-9 against the fixed 1e-10 gate,
core-affine/higher-rank slowdown, centered qualification, incomplete callback
coverage, and missing terminal comparisons. The latest earlier comparison
had 18 valid pairs and 840 missing; this is not a current completion result.
No merge, repository-wide policy-compliance or default-readiness claim is justified.
